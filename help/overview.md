## CloudBees CD Integration to WebSphere
You can use this plugin to interact with an IBM
WebSphere Server. You can start and stop the server.
You can also manage applications within the server (start,
deploy, undeploy, stop or custom task) using the provided
WebSphere scripts in the **bin** directory under
the installation home directory (wsadmin, startServer,
stopServer). You can run Jython scripts that are
provided by the user or defined when a procedure is
created.

## Integrated Version

The plugin was tested on following WebSphere versions:


 - WAS and WASND 9.0 on Linux and Windows
 - WAS and WASND 8.5.5 on Linux and Windows
 - WAS and WASND 8.5.0 on Linux and Windows
 - WAS and WASND 8.0 on Linux and Windows
 - WAS 7.0 on Linux and Windows.
   Beginning Release 2.4 we do not certify this plugin on the 7.0 version of WAS considering that this version is not actively supported by IBM since April 2018.
