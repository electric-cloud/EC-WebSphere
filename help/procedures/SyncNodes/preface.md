**Applicable only for WebSphere Network Deployment installation.**
Synchronizes Cell's Deployment Manager config repository with nodes of the cell. By default, WebSphere nodes are configured for auto-sync. This procedure should be used for manual nodes synchronization. For example: New custom property for node was added, and configuration was saved. Next, to make it available on each server it should be propagated to all servers of the node by nodes synchronization.
