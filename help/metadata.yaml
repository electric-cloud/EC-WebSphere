knownIssues:
  - During testing by our automation undefined behaviour has been discovered.
    After quick multiple creation-deletion of application server without pauses newly created application servers sometimes this application server could not be started.
    In that case websphere log will contain nullpointer exception. This issue doesn't happen in real use cases inend-to-end scenarios.
