knownIssues: |
  During testing by our automation undefined behaviour has been discovered.
  If one try to delete application server with server name or node name with special characters, like !#*&Node1 or !#*&Node1,
  websphere will throw an exception as expected, but next created application server will not be able to start.
  In that case websphere log will contain nullpointer exception. This issue doesn't happen in real use cases inend-to-end scenarios.
