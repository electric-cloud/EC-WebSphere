Plugin version @PLUGIN_VERSION@
Revised on February 1, 2021


== Integrated Version

The plugin was tested on following WebSphere versions:

* WAS and WASND 9.0 on Linux and Windows
* WAS and WASND 8.5.5 on Linux and Windows
* WAS and WASND 8.5.0 on Linux and Windows
* WAS and WASND 8.0 on Linux and Windows
* WAS 7.0 on Linux and Windows.
 Beginning Release 2.4 we do not certify this plugin on the 7.0 version of WAS considering that this version is not actively supported by IBM since April 2018.
 Please refer to this https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ssi/rep_ca/3/897/ENUS916-143/index.html&amp;lang=en&amp;request_locale=en[IBM Link]











== Plugin Configurations
Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
across some or all of the plugin procedures. They
reduce repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets for end users, and
securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
is given a unique name that is entered in designated
parameters on procedures that use them.


=== Creating Plugin Configurations
To create plugin configurations in {CD}, do these steps:

* Go to **Administration** &gt;**Plugins** to open the Plugin Manager.
* Find the EC-WebSphere-@PLUGIN_VERSION@ row.
* Click *Configure* to open the
     Configurations page.
* Click *Create Configuration* as per the description of parameters below.


*Note: After you perform the setup below it is important to make sure that the {CD} agent machine on which WebSphere runs is registered as a resource that can be pinged.*
